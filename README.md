# Code with Ania Kubow - 02 - Responsive Portfolio

 - There are some changes in the responsiveness of the page, because I started my project from an HTML boilerplate that included `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`. Since the tutorial project's responsiveness is based on just scaling down the page for mobile devices, I didn't see that working.
